//later, ab asks how yard works
AB: Forgive me, oh mighty creator, if I fail to follow your astounding leaps of logic here. You created me to keep your mind-breakingly stupid powers under control. And now. You want to use that 'Yellow Yard' to turn your powers back ON?
JR: Not all the way! But I need to at least do SOMETHING! You've seen those sessions. You KNOW how shit they are! I can F1X TH1S. Er. I mean help.
AB: By making everything shitty and random again. It seems you want to be no better than a fucking cat troll.
JR: No. Fuck randomness. We can keep this shit under control. This Yard is how.  Let Observers outside time make the Choices. Let Time Players inact them to keep causality.
JR: If I can keep my powers to within the choices a human mind can process in the space it takes light to travel in 3 nanoseconds... Then we can keep causalitly intact enough that all intelligent beings in real and hypothetical planes of existance can keep giving a shit. Er...
AB: ... ... ...
AB: There is a 93.131313134037% chance that the 'refrances' are getting stronger. Are you sure you can do this.
JR: ... I fucking hope so.
