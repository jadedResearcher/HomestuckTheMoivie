DIRK: Jake, I'm not marrying shit.
DIRK: And frankly, you've got some nerve floating down here babbling about marriage with that shit eating grin and that dumb little pumpkin on your head.
DIRK: After the way you ditched me and ignored all my messages?
DIRK: You know what, if you didn't like me anymore and wanted to stop hanging out, then fine, I could handle that.
DIRK: But to just completely shut me out, like I didn't even deserve an explanation, that's just cowardly. Why couldn't you just man up and talk to me?
DIRK: You act like I don't have feelings. Like I'm some kind of robot. Well you're wrong, I do.
DIRK: And I'm using those feelings by starting to FEEL like you're actually kind of an asshole.
DIRK: So whatever you were so afraid to tell me before your fucking sugar high, don't worry about it, I'll save you the trouble.
DIRK: It's over, Jake.

ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Alright, no takers there I see. Only a pair of grotesque philistines blustering through the same coarse ignorance tunnel
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> What about you, miss unpalatable combination of Feferi and
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> And

ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, help, I'm having a problem
DIRK: What??
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> A part of me is having a very STRONG emotional reaction which I don't like
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's a part of myself I'm ashamed of
DIRK: What part.
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The troll part. It did something shameful once
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I do not find such emotions to be an acceptable feature of my new e%istence
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> How can I make this feeling go away
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dirk, I command you to instruct me how to eliminate these emotions
DIRK: Can't help you bro!
DIRK: This is what you asked for. You said you were scared to not exist.
DIRK: Well, this is what it's like to keep on existing. Better figure out how to deal!
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> No. That's awful
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I don't know what to do
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> With all of my astounding STRENGTH, both muscular and cerebral, how can I be stymied so?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Dying was better than having to live with the shame which was ironically caused by the very death in question
ERISOLSPRITE: equiiu2 wwhat the FUCK are you talkiing about.
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You, seadwelling mustard b100d
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Half of me commands the peasant half of you to resolve my emotional turmoil, while humbly requesting the noble half of you to do the same
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> The other half of me doesn't give a flying hoot about your lame caste bulls‑‑t and is just kind of freaking out internally about this
ERISOLSPRITE: ehehehe wwoww zahhak you miight actually be more a me22 than me, ii am fuckiin iimpre22ed.

ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> You're right, I must speak to her
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Nepeta, I swore that I would protect you, but I failed
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> In a moment of weakness my reverence for a superior got the better of me, and instead of standing up for you I decided to bow before a stupid f‑‑‑‑‑g juggalo or something? What?
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Wait, I actually did that? What the fresh nickering h‑‑l is WRONG with me?
FEFETASPRITE: 38(( < 38\
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> I am not a perfect man, Nepeta. Nor am I "purrfect" as you might say. What the fudge? A cat pun? Let's pull our s‑‑t together dude, this emotional state is mad abysmal
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> But in any case, I hope you can find it within your kind olive pump biscuit to... forgive...
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> NO!
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> GOSH DANGIT! I don't deserve to be forgiven, what am I saying! The s‑‑t I pulled on you was so bad... I just can't even...

ERISOLSPRITE: heheh, fef can you BELIIEVVE thii2 guy??
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> Do not address Feferi while I'm talking Nepeta
ARQUIUSPRITE: shaDes --> It's confusing to Nepeta, who is critical in absolving me of guilt, even though I probably don't deserve it?
