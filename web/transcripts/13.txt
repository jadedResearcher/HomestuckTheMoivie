uu: HELLO DIRK IN THE PAST.
uu: LET'S PLAY A GAME.
TT: Alright.
uu: DO NOT EVEN FuCK WITH ME.
uu: I WANT TO PLAY A GAME WITH YOu. AND A GAME IS EXACTLY THAT WHICH WILL BE PLAYED BETWEEN uS.
TT: I said I'd play.
uu: DIRK. I WANT YOu TO DRAW ME SOME PORNOGRAPHY.
TT: You got it.
uu: IF YOu FAIL TO DRAW ME SOME PORNOGRAPHY.
uu: THERE WILL BE CONSEQuENCES.
uu: AND WHEN CONSEQuENCES HAPPEN. THAT IS WHEN BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW.
uu: YOuR FuTuRE SELF SPENDS ALL HIS TIME BEING IN THE FuTuRE. HE PRIORITIZES BEING IN THE FuTuRE AND FIGHTING DRONES OVER PLAYING MY GAMES.
uu: YOuR PAST SELF SHOuLD CONSIDER THE COSTLY INDISCRETION OF YOuR FuTuRE SELF'S BEHAVIOR. BEHAVIOR WHICH ENTAILS BEING IN THE FuTuRE ALMOST AS MuCH AS NOT DOING WHATEVER I FuCKING TELL HIM TO.
TT: Dude, I'm sitting here with my stylus ready to go. Do you want me to draw you some porn or not.
uu: OH YES.
uu: YOu WILL DRAW ME MY PORNOGRAPHY, DIRK HuMAN STRIDER.

uu: AND HER BODY. WILL BECOME A STuPID CORPSE.
uu: HER MOON BODY I MEAN.
uu: IT WILL MARK THE BEGINNING. AT LEAST.
uu: OF MY uLTIMATE VICTORY IN THIS GAME BETWEEN uS.
uu: BETWEEN ME AND HER. NOT ME AND YOu.
uu: DIRK LET'S PLAY A GAME.
TT: Dude, listen. I am perfectly willing to draw you some pornography.
TT: It doesn't need to be part of a game. You don't got to murder nobody.
uu: I WILL IF YOu DON'T DO WHAT I SAY.
uu: HOW VERY IRONIC. THAT A LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. uPON YOuR WILLINGNESS TO DRAW ME SOME PORNOGRAPHY.
uu: THE VERY PORNOGRAPHY. WHICH YOu HAVE SPENT A LIFETIME DRAWING. IN YOuR SPARE TIME. BECAuSE YOu PRESuMABLY ENJOY DOING SO.
TT: How is that ironic?
uu: OH YES. HOW IRONIC IT IS INDEED.
uu: AND IT IS FuRTHER IRONIC. THAT THIS GAME IS IRONIC.
uu: IT IS THE VERY IRONY. WHICH YOu YOuRSELF HAVE SPENT A LIFETIME WALLOWING IN.
uu: AND uSING TO JuSTIFY INTERESTS AND BEHAVIORS. WHICH ARE DuMB AND CONFuSING.
TT: Whoa. Mindfuck.

TT: What now.

uu: THERE WILL BE NEW ACTORS IN THIS VuLGAR EXHIBITION.
uu: YOu WILL INCLuDE THE JAKE AND ROXY HuMANS NOW. AND IT WILL BE SIMILARLY DISGuSTING.

TT: http://goo.gl/itJga

TT: So are we done?
uu: YOu WOuLD LOVE THAT. WOuLDN'T YOu.
TT: Nah. I'm fine with doing more if you want.
uu: HOW CONVENIENT IT WOuLD BE FOR YOu. IF WE STOPPED PLAYING MY GAME. AND LET MY SISTER OFF THE HOOK.
TT: Do you want me to pretend I don't want to play?
TT: Like, is that part of the kink for you? Kind of a roleplaying thing?
uu: SHuT THE FuCK uP.
TT: "No, no, please. Don't make me draw any more pics of my friends snuggling and stuff."
TT: Strider said, having spent the better part of the night gnawing through his duct tape gag.
uu: LOOK AT THESE PATHETIC STALLING TACTICS. AS IF I DON'T KNOW AN ATTEMPT TO DERAIL ONE OF MY DIABOLICAL GAMES.
uu: WHEN I SEE ONE.
TT: That's good. Keep saying things like that.
TT: I'll keep doing my part.
TT: "Somebody save me from this LIVING NIGHTMARE. The things he has made me DO."
uu: MAYBE YOuR IRREVERENCE FOR MY GAME. STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT YOu DON'T GIVE A FLYING FuCK ABOuT MY IDIOT SISTER?
uu: HA. LIKE I COuLD EVEN BLAME YOu. WHAT A CLOYING WINDBAG SHREW. SHE IS WORTHLESS TO EVERYBODY. I THINK YOu THINK SO TOO.

uu: DIRK I WANT TO PLAY A GAME.
TT: Do you now.
uu: THOuGH YOu MAY NOT CARE ABOuT MY SISTER'S LIFE. THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH MAY MOTIVATE YOu TO KEEP PLAYING.
uu: AND THAT IS. CuRIOSITY.
TT: How so?
uu: AHAHAHA! YOu SEE!!! THAT RIGHT THERE. YOu ASKED A QuESTION.
uu: ASKING SHIT IS WHAT BEING CuRIOuS MEANS. I FuCKING WIN ALREADY. YOu TRASH.
TT: Damn.
TT: Owned.
uu: BuT THAT'S WHAT YOu DO WHEN YOu HAVE A SHITTY TWIST ENDING. PLANNED AT THE END OF ALL YOuR GAMES.
uu: SEE. THIS GAME HAS A TWIST. IT IS TWISTED LIKE A LITTLE CANDY SWIRL. THAT IS A KISS ON YOuR FACE FROM AN ANGEL. WHILE YOu MAKE A FuCKING FOOL OF YOuRSELF IN YOuR SLEEP.
TT: I know what a twist is.
TT: Or I did, until you kept saying stupid shit that doesn't mean anything.
uu: EXACTLY.
uu: IF YOu WANT TO KNOW MY SHITTY TWIST.
uu: YOu HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING MY GAME.
TT: Well, not only was I pretty psyched to keep playing regardless.
TT: I'd rather do just about anything than listen to you ramble on and on about your horseshit twists.
uu: VERY GOOD.
uu: THE LECHEROuS AMuSEMENTS.
uu: THEY WILL NOW INVOLVE.
uu: THE BOTH JANE AND ROXY HuMANS.
TT: Cool.
uu: AW YES. DOuBLE THE TASTY BITCHES.

uu: BLuE AND PINK. GET BETWEEN MY JAWS. POOFY FLuFFY COTTON CANDY. LET ME DISSOLVE YOu.
uu: THAT IS WHAT I CALL THIS PAIRING. OF NASTY PREMIuM BITCHES.
TT: You know, considering you're obviously just going to ask for more ultra-tame shit, you still somehow made this legitimately creepy.
TT: Nicely done, I guess?
uu: AH YES. HOW YOu SQuIRM NOW.
TT: I'm not squirming.
uu: LIKE BuLLFuCK YOu AREN'T.
uu: NOW DRAW.
TT: I'm already drawing.
TT: What should I make these "premium bitches" do?

uu: NOTHING JuST YET. WE WILL NOT BE RECKLESS WITH THEIR COuRTSHIP.
uu: THEY TAKE THINGS SLOW. WE MILK THIS FuCKER AND MAKE ITS TEAT OuR BITCH. IT WILL BE DELICIOuS.
TT: Ok.
TT: So they're just...
TT: Standing there?
uu: ONE OF THEM IS SHY AND RELuCTANT TO ADVANCE.
uu: JANE. THE JANE HuMAN IS RELuCTANT AND SHY.
uu: YOu WILL RENDER THE JANE HuMAN AS SHOWING A BASHFuL AND COQuETTISH DEMEANOR.
uu: I DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEONE DRAWS THAT THOuGH. I'M NOT A FuCKING ARTIST.
uu: YOu'RE THE ARTIST. MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND MAKE IT PERFECT.
TT: Not a problem.
TT: Ok:
TT: http://goo.gl/HmRpl
uu: OOOOOOOH. LOOK AT HER.
uu: SHE HAS HER EYE ON THAT ROMANTICALLY DESIRABLE BITCH. OH WHAT SHE WOuLD SAY TO HER. IF SHE COuLD SuMMON THE NERVE.
TT: Maybe she wants to ask her out?
uu: SHuT uP. I'M RuNNING THIS.
uu: NOW.
uu: THE ROXY HuMAN TAKES THE INITIATIVE IN THE ENCOuNTER.
uu: SHE PLACES HER BEVERAGE ON THE FLOOR. SHE SAuNTERS uP TO JANE. AND PERPETRATES ONE OF YOuR HuMAN "WINKS".
TT: http://goo.gl/WrdJG
uu: SHE KEEPS HER FuCKING HAND TO HERSELF YOu PRESuMPTuOuS TOOL.
uu: ERASE THAT. NOW.
TT: http://goo.gl/Ay8mv
uu: AND NOW.
uu: THE ROXY HuMAN OPENS HER HEART. AND PROFESSES HER "FEELINGS".
uu: THE BITCH TELLS THE OTHER BITCH A POEM.
uu: MAKE THE BITCH SAY A POEM. DO IT.
TT: Sure.
TT: http://goo.gl/1Ha6R
uu: DAMN! OH DAMN.
uu: HA HA. LOOK AT HER. SHE'S EATING THAT SHIT uP.
uu: GIVE THE BITCH A ROSE!
TT: Ok.
TT: Wait.
TT: Which one?
uu: NO WAIT.
uu: BOTH BITCHES GIVE *EACH OTHER* A FuCKING ROSE!!!
TT: http://goo.gl/GLNHH
uu: YES!
uu: YES!
uu: NOW MAKE HER.
uu: MAKE HER DO THE THING. THE SHAMEFuL THING WHERE SHE RuBS THE ROSE ON THE HER FACE.
uu: YOu KNOW. THE HuMAN PRACTICE. WHEREBY POIGNANT EMOTIONS ARE CONDuCTED THROuGH FACIAL TISSuE.

TT: http://goo.gl/XE2fl

TT: http://goo.gl/2HsXl
uu: uuuuuuNGH.
uu: OH *MERRRCY*.
uu: THAT IS JuST.
uu: SOO.
uu: GRODY.
TT: Does your sister even know you're into this sappy shipping stuff?
TT: You berate her constantly for everything, and I know she likes to write and illustrate romfics and the like.
uu: NO. SHE ENJOYS IT FOR WRONG AND DISGuSTING REASONS.
uu: HER FASCINATION WITH THE RED STIRRINGS OF INFERIOR RACES. IT STRIKES ME AS TOO SINCERE AND THEREFORE REPELLENT.
uu: MY ENJOYMENT IS. IRONIC.
TT: Again, you just don't seem to know what ironic means.
TT: Your enjoyment of this content is clearly sincere. You are just fetishizing your "disgust" for it, is all.
uu: FuCK YOu WITH THAT ASSESSMENT.
uu: YOu DON'T TELL ME. OF WHAT VALuE THE PORNOGRAPHY HAS TO ME. IN MY OWN GAME.
uu: YOu JuST FuCKING DRAW. AND DON'T TALK.
TT: I'm just saying, it's an interest you have in common. If you told her you liked her romantic artwork, maybe you could bond over that?
uu: BONDING.
uu: IS THE LAST FuCKING THING WE NEED TO DO.
uu: I HAVE NOT TOLD HER OF MY IRONIC FASCINATIONS. AND YOu WILL NOT EITHER.
uu: I WILL NOT TELL HER. THAT I SECRETLY PERuSE HER WORK IN A STATE OF PETRIFIED MORTIFICATION FOR HOuRS. AND NEITHER WILL YOu.
TT: Fair enough.
TT: So, game over yet?
uu: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
uu: NO.
uu: I SAID BEFORE.
uu: THESE STEAMY BOTHERED uP BITCHES ARE HuNGRY FOR SWEETS.
uu: THE JANE HuMAN HAS BAKED A CAKE.

TT: Ok.
TT: http://goo.gl/vvYxn

uu: IT'S MOIST AS SHIT. IT TEMPTS THEM. THEY BEGIN TO HuMAN SALIVATE.
TT: http://goo.gl/vsGuq
uu: THE MuTuALLY SWOONING BITCHES GET FRISKY WITH THE TREAT.
uu: ROXY HuMAN CHOPS OuT A WEDGE. FEEDS IT TO JANE HuMAN'S ZEALOuS SNACK HOLE.
TT: Ok.
uu: BuT. NOT SO FAST.
uu: SHE SMuSHES IT AROuND THE GREEDY CAKESLuT'S HuMAN LIPS AND FEATuRES.
uu: MISGuIDED FEELINGS OF FONDNESS AND LEVITY WAX INCREMENTALLY.
uu: A GIGGLE IS RELEASED.
TT: Oh shit.
TT: Things are really heating up now.
TT: http://goo.gl/v33Yj
uu: YES. FuCK YES.
uu: I WANT THEM TO HuMAN "HOLD HANDS". THEY WILL HuMAN "HOLD HANDS" NOW.
uu: THEIR ODIOuS "LOVE" IS BLOSSOMING BEFORE OuR EYES AND TO OuR uNSPEAKABLE DISMAY. CAN YOu FEEL IT DIRK?
TT: Yes.
uu: MAKE THEIR CAKEY HANDS. BECOME CLASPED TOGETHER AS ONE.
uu: IT FEELS MuSHY AND SLIPPERY. THEY ENJOY THE SENSATION IMMENSELY. IT IS VILE.
TT: http://goo.gl/ObEuT
uu: YES!

uu: GET THE FuCKING CAMERA CLOSER YOu DOuCHE BAG!
uu: I WANT TO SEE SOME *DETAIL*. HIGH DEF THAT STICKY MESS.
TT: http://goo.gl/gz1iH
uu: OHHHHHHHHHH.
uu: FuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuCK.
uu: THAT IS JuST DOWNRIGHT.
uu: *AFFFFFFFECTIONAAAAAATE.*

TT: Yeah.
TT: Those girls sure are diggin' each other.
TT: That's how we humans roll.
TT: Eat some cake. Hold some hands.
uu: AH. BuT THEIR TAWDRY ROMP IS FAR FROM OVER.
uu: JANE HAS HAD A LITTLE TOO MuCH CAKE TO EAT.
uu: PERHAPS HER HuMAN TuMMY NEEDS A RuB?
TT: Ha ha.
TT: Oh god.
uu: WHAT'S THIS! COuLD IT BE.
uu: YOuR BREAKING POINT IS IN SIGHT.
uu: YOu ARE BECOMING SQuEAMISH. I CAN FEEL IT.
uu: YES.
uu: YESSSSS.
TT: If you think this is making me uncomfortable, think again.
uu: NO I'LL THINK ONLY ONCE. YOu ARE SuCCuMBING TO MY GAME. YOu ARE BECOMING PSYCHOLOGICALLY uNGLuED AND I AM WINNING.
TT: Nice wishful thinking there.
TT: I'm not even merely tolerating this, bro.
TT: I swear to god, I'll get my own horse running harder in this fuckin' race than you could ever dream.
uu: WHAT. HORSE?
TT: Think I'll blink first, motherfucker?
TT: Not happening.
TT: I might splinter.
TT: But I don't break.
uu: OH WHATEVER. ASSHOLE.
uu: IS THAT SuPPOSED TO BE "COOL".
TT: You want a fuckin' tummy rub?
TT: That shit sounds white hot. I can't wait to draw that and get us both sexually stimulated.
TT: Here I goddamn go. Boners galore.
TT: http://goo.gl/zJgPI
TT: This is giving me the biggest male human boner of my entire erection life.
uu: STOP MENTIONING MALE HuMAN BONERS.
uu: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE. AND I DON'T WANT TO.
uu: SO IF THAT WAS THE PLAN ALL ALONG.
uu: TO MENTION BONERS.
uu: YOuR PLAN FuCKING SuCKED.
TT: You want a shitty twist?
TT: http://goo.gl/8WOPP
uu: OK.
uu: WE'RE DONE HERE.
uu: THIS GAME IS OVER.
TT: Aw, that's it?
TT: I thought we were getting into a good rhythm there.
TT: Anyway, you missed out on like half the pairings.
uu: WHAT. HALF. NO WE DID MOST OF THEM DIDN'T WE.
TT: No, we did three, and there are three possible matchups left.
TT: Don't you know anything about shipping science?
uu: THAT'S A THING?
uu: HOW THE FuCK COuLD THAT BE A THING.
TT: Believe me.
TT: It's a thing.
TT: Total number of pairings for a group of n people is (n^2 - n) / 2.
TT: You divide by 2 to cut the grid in half, eliminate duplicate pairs.
TT: Minus n is so you don't pair people up with themselves. That wouldn't make sense.
uu: AND WHY THE FuCK NOT??
TT: Well, because...
TT: I don't know.
TT: Maybe you're right. Maybe I was being close-minded about self-pairing. What do I know?
uu: JACK SHIT OBVIOuSLY.
uu: ANYWAY. FuCK ALL THAT. YOu DON'T SPOIL GOOD DEBAuCHERY. WITH A LOT OF STuPID MATH.
uu: YOu MAY THINK YOu'RE SMART. BuT EXCESSIVE SMARTNESS CAN MAKE YOu BE MORE OF AN IDIOT.
uu: INTELLIGENT IDIOCY CAN BE EASILY EXPLOITED BY THE CuNNING AND RuTHLESS. JuST A TIP FOR YOu. BRO.
TT: I'll make a note.
TT: So you sure you don't want even one more drawing?
TT: You used Jane and Roxy in two pairings. But me and Jake only got one.
TT: How is that fair?
uu: I DECIDE WHAT IS FAIR IN MY GAMES.
uu: IF YOu ARE PROPOSING TO ILLuSTRATE THE JAKE HuMAN BEHAVING AMOROuSLY WITH THE DIRK HuMAN. THE ANSWER IS NO.
TT: Why not?
uu: THAT ENCOuNTER DOES NOT SEEM AS REPREHENSIBLY SCANDALOuS.
uu: FIRST OF ALL. I ASK OF YOu. WHERE ARE THE BITCHES AT?
uu: I REST MY CASE.
TT: Lame.
uu: SECOND OF ALL. I DON'T WISH TO LANGuISH IN THE PuMPKIN PATCH.
TT: What?
uu: ORANGE AND EMERALD. uNPLEASANT TOGETHER.
uu: I HAVE NO TASTE FOR PuMPKINS. OR ANY HORRID VEGETABLE MATTER.
uu: MEAT OR CANDY. THAT'S WHAT'S GOOD. THE GAME IS OVER.
TT: Fine.
TT: I'll keep all my illustrated debasements to myself, then.
uu: GOOD. DO THAT.
TT: Ok. I will.
TT: So did I win?
uu: I WILL SAY.
uu: YES.
uu: YOu WERE COOPERATIVE AND GENERALLY ENTHuSED ABOuT MY GAME.
uu: CONGRATuLATIONS DIRK.
TT: Thanks.
TT: So what's the shitty twist?
uu: AH! BuT NOT SO FAST.
uu: YOu SEE. THERE IS A TWIST TO MY SHITTY TWIST.
TT: A twisted twist?
TT: Like... a double mobius handjob or something?
uu: YES. PROBABLY.
TT: Ok.
TT: What is the twist to the twist?
uu: THE TWIST TO THE TWIST IS.
uu: I WON'T TELL YOu WHAT THE SHITTY TWIST IS FOR A YEAR!!!
TT: Wow.
TT: That...
TT: Really is quite a shitty twist.
uu: YOuR GRATIFICATION ON THIS MATTER WILL BE DELAYED.
uu: I HAVE NOTICED. AS YOuR AWFuL MEANDERING SAGA WENDS ITS WAY. THROuGH THE ASS CRACK OF NOWHERE AND BACK.
uu: ANSWERS TO POINTLESS QuESTIONS ARE OFTEN DEFERRED. NIGH INDEFINITELY.
uu: AND SO THIS WILL CAuSE YOu TO REFLECT. uPON A LIFETIME SPENT.
uu: BEING INSIDE A BuLLSHIT STORY LIKE THAT.
uu: IS THE IRONY NOT FuCKING DELICIOuS?
TT: Not really.
uu: I WILL TELL YOu THE FATE OF MY SISTER IN ONE YEAR.
uu: AT THAT TIME I WILL TELL YOu THE TWIST.
uu: AND ALTHOuGH YOu PLAYED MY GAME SuCCESSFuLLY.
uu: IN ORDER TO SPARE HER LIFE.
uu: IT WILL HAVE TuRNED OuT.
uu: ALL ALONG.
uu: TO YOuR SHOCK AND ASTONISHMENT.
uu: THAT...

uu: I ALREADY KILLED HER!!!!!
TT: What?
TT: Killed who?
uu: AHHH. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA.
TT: Oh, right.
TT: I forgot about this horseshit.
uu: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.
