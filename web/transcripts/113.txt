JR: I just don't think this is what my powers are SUPPOSED to do.
KR: Why not?
JR: Everything is random! That's not... Bluuuuuh. I can FEEL that's not right. Things weren't like that back on Earth.
KR: I thought mind was about Choices, not Randomness?
JR: Yeah, but if you make ALL Choices that's the same damn thing as making none of them. It's like. It's like somehow fucking everything is canon. I hate it.
KR: ... And that's why you're making this robot of yourself?
JR: Exactly! I can FEEL it's wrong but I can't put my finger on why. AB....if I can get her working...she can tell me where things are breaking causlity. Causality. Whatever.
KR: And then you...?
JR: And then I F1X TH1S. Er. Fix it. The point is then I can stop Laying Waste to Choices. I'm tired of doing that.
KR: Fair enough. Good luck.
JR: Luck doesn't even matter. I'll make SURE of it.
