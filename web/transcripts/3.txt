* The above is approximately what the human eye can make out,
*  and I claim that's the intended narrative at this point.

* But through image forensics on animated gif frames, colors and pixel edges,
*  a fairly definite version of the original text was discovered [http://bladekindeyewear.tumblr.com/post/53002453932/complete-deobfuscation-of-roses-text].

* TT: I believe Jade has officially gone grimbark.
* TT: She seems to be working against us now. She has split us up, keeping us quarantined to our own planets.
* TT: I believe she’s functioning at the behest of the Condesce, through some form of coercion or mind control.
* TT: This means she’s attempting to finish our session for us while keeping us separated and neutralized. ((could be more here))
* TT: But there appears to be a reason for the way she has divided and grouped us. She may still have a purpose for us.
* TT: I think however John has managed to elude her. Have you heard from him?
